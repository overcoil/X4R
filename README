This is my first project on github and R so pardon any omissions or errors.

I didn't find out where to put my attributions for the code that I used so I'll put them here for the while:

1. gSOAP
2. RapidXML


Installation

1. Download R. (version 3.1.1 or later)
2. Download Rtools. Ensure the path points to Rtools bin and Rtools gcc bin
3. Clone the github project. (i.e. $git clone https://github.com/overcoil/X4R)
4. Launch R and install Rcpp package (i.e. > install.packages("Rcpp")). Ensure that it can be loaded and no error messages show up (i.e. > library(Rcpp)).
5. Exit from R and compile and install the package by executing the command $R CMD INSTALL X4R (this should be done in the directory containing X4R)
If you run into an error message about not being able to find Rcpp, set the environment variable R_LIBS_USER to point to the location of the R libraries (this can be found by going to R and running the command > .libPaths())
Done.

If you only need the 32-bit version, run $R CMD INSTALL with --no-multiarch flag.


Usage:
See manual for more information regarding each function. The manual can be found within the "man" directory of the project.
